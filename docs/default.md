# Default Layout Examples

Glove80 ships several stock layouts curated by MoErgo.  The `layouts/default` directory tracks the JSON artifacts
exported from the layout editor so they can be referenced alongside TailorKey and QuantumTouch.

These JSON files are stored verbatim; they are not regenerated from Python code yet.  Keeping them under version control
ensures we can diff against MoErgo’s published versions and build code-driven equivalents later if needed.
